## Methodology  
The assessments followed these key steps:  
1. **Reconnaissance:**  
   Gathering system and network information using tools such as **Nmap** and **Nessus**.  
2. **Vulnerability Exploitation:**  
   Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities using **Metasploit**, **Hydra**, and manual techniques.  
3. **Post-Exploitation:**  
   Gaining persistence, escalating privileges, and evaluating system impact.  
4. **Documentation:**  
   Writing detailed reports for each assessment, including identified vulnerabilities, their impact, and suggested mitigations.
